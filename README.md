# app_template

A #Flutter #template that can be used for all your flutter #projects. You can modify to suit you use case. I normally prefer to go by this approach.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:  [https://github.com/TchallaAlbertKwame/app_template.git](https://github.com/TchallaAlbertKwame/app_template.git)
## Run:  
flutter clean  
flutter pub get   
 flutter run  
### Enjoy flutter development!
